# Lunch-Project

This is the submission for Project #1 for the Northwestern bootcamp by Jack Kennedy, Brendan Scruggs, Maddy Griffin, and AJ Maravilla.

The project is an app called Let's Do Lunch. 

On the app, you first login with unique information, then create a lunch group from a selection of nearby restaurants. 

You can then view the lunch groups you have created in the My Groups page and leave the group if needed.

We still need to add functionality to the Find Groups page, which should hypothetically allow you to find and join groups created by other people.
